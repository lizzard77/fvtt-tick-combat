# embeds

Embed cloud documents or any website into Foundry journals.

I have seen a lot of people asking how to embed a Google Document, a 
website with a certain map or something like that into Foundry VTT. 
This little helper makes it easy to create a Journal Entry with 
an embedded iframe that displays a certain URL. Just click the 
sidebar button in the Journals tab.
